# E-commerce HayStore

Haystore is a fake E-commerce store built with C# and ASP.Net, this is a project to showcase my skills with C# and .Net, most layout are from Amazon because the point is to make a fake amazon website.

## Inspiration

I got this idea when I was when I was browsing Linkedin post and people often said"You don't have to build anything new to showcase your skills, just copy a well-known website to showcase", and I think this is a good oppotunity to recap how to build a Multi-Page Application and to showcase my skills in C# and .Net.

## Tools

* #### C#
* #### .Net

## Redirect
<a href="https://haystore.herokuapp.com/">To the page</a>
